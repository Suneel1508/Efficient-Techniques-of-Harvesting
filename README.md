# Efficient-Techniques-of-Harvesting

## Summary
This project aims to leverage machine learning (ML) techniques to enhance agricultural outcomes by predicting harvest results based on historical data. Recognizing the critical role of farmers in the economy, the project focuses on mitigating losses caused by improper pesticide usage. By analyzing labeled data encompassing factors such as pesticide usage, soil parameters, and historic crop yield, the project employs algorithms like Random Forest, Decision Tree, Artificial Neural Networks, and logistic algorithms to predict harvest outcomes and recommend suitable crops. The goal is to empower farmers with insights into crop health and assist in decision-making for optimal yields.

## Problem Statement
Pesticides are special, because while they protect the crop with the right dosage. But, if you add more than required, they may spoil the entire harvest. This data is based on crops harvested by various farmers at the end of harvest season. We also took another dataset that represents the chemicals and humidity present in the soil, in order to predict which crop to grow. To simplify the problem, we can assume that all other factors like variations in farming techniques have been controlled for.
Determining the outcome of the harvest season, i.e. whether the crop would be healthy (alive), damaged by pesticides or damaged by other reasons.
Determining the type of crop that has to be cultivated on that particular soil, in order to achieve more yield.

## Objectives
The following are the objectives of this project:
* To provide an efficient model to farmers for their best practices.
* To Enhance the Crop status after the whole harvest season
* To predict whether the crop is alive or damaged by pesticides or damaged by some other reason.
* To recommend which crop should be cultivated in their lands according to their soil fertility.
* To provide the farmers a user friendly front end to use this model and use them for their harvest prediction and crop recommendation.
